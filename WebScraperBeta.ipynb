      " I’M CURRENTLY READING A JOSEPH BEUYS BIOGRAPHY, WHICH IS VERY SOOTHING. I FEEL THAT HIS WAS A SELF-CONTAINED WORLD THAT I WOULD KIND OF ASPIRE TO. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THAT IS MY OWN PROJECTION, MY FANTASY AND MY INTERPRETATION OF WHO JOSEPH BEUYS WAS, BUT I ALLOW MYSELF TO ROMANTICISE IT BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT MORE FUN. I SUSPECT THAT PEOPLE DO KIND OF THE SAME WITH ME. THEY ARE ROMANTICIZING ME TO FIT THEIR NEEDS, AND THAT’S FINE. I AM HAPPY TO BE SOME KIND OF SYMBOL THAT THEY CAN ELABORATE ON. \n",

BY EXAMINING THESE THINGS AND BY DEMYSTIFYING THEM, AND BY ME REASSURING OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE ALL FELT AND EXPERIENCED THEM – THAT IS WHAT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED TO. \n",

EVERYBODY’S MAIN MOTIVATION IN LIFE IS TO BE LISTENED TO, BY THEIR LOVED ONES, BY THEIR CHILDREN, BY SOCIETY. WE ALL WANT TO BE HEARD, AND TO BE ABLE TO DO SO IS ONE OF THE MOST VALIDATING PRIZES IN LIFE. TO BE PART OF THE LIVES OF SUCH INTELLIGENT AND CULTIVATED PEOPLE IS DEEPLY, DEEPLY EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING. I SENT OUT A MESSAGE AND PEOPLE RESPONDED. \n",

I MEAN, THERE IS A LOT THAT GOES INTO SUPPORTING THE CREATIVITY OF THIS KIND OF VENTURE, AND AT FIRST I ALWAYS WROTE THE WHOLE EXPANSION AND COLLABORATION THING OFF AS HYPE, BUT IT ACTUALLY BECAME KIND OF FUN. HAVING BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE ISOLATED MYSELF A BIT TOO MUCH AND THIS WAS A CHANCE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MORE PEOPLE. \n",

I GUESS YOU WANT TO BE DISCREET BUT AVAILABLE AT THE SAME TIME. I STILL HAVEN’T FIGURED OUT THE RIGHT BALANCE, BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND EXPLORE, AND CAN’T BE SELF-SATISFIED AND REMAIN IN A SMALL CORNER RESTING ON OUR LAURELS. \n",

THEY CAN BE INVENTIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT CAN CREATE UNUSUAL ALLIANCES, AND THERE IS SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ALLY YOURSELF WITH SOMEONE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE CONSIDERED BEFORE. THERE ARE BENEFITS AND THERE ARE DISADVANTAGES, WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU’RE BEING EXPOSED TO TOO MANY PEOPLE, BUT, YOU KNOW, AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME, I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 20 YEARS, AND WE NEED TO EXPLORE AND TO PUSH OURSELVES TO HAVE SOME ADVENTURES.

      " I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK OWENS THROUGH INTERNET FORUMS AROUND 2013, BUT IT WASN’T UNTIL 2016 THAT I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO WEAR PIECES FROM THE BRAND. TO ME, THE BRAND IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MYSELF IN THE MOST FUN WAY THROUGH EXCITING CLOTHING FROM AN ECCENTRIC DESIGNER WITH A HUMBLE BACKGROUND. WHAT MAKES RICK’S BRAND UNIQUE IS THE CONSISTENT DESIGN LANGUAGE THAT I SEE ACROSS ALL HIS CLOTHING, WHICH BRINGS SYNERGY TO EVERYTHING, EVEN ACROSS SEASONS. AS FOR RICK HIMSELF, I’VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED HOW CANDID AND SELF-DEPRECATING HE IS IN HIS INTERVIEWS ABOUT HIS LIFE, HIS INSPIRATIONS, AND HIS QUIRKS. \n",

      " RICK OWENS: WELL, OBVIOUSLY BLACK IS MY FAVOURITE, BUT I LIKE OFF-WHITE, LIKE WEARING OLD WHITE T-SHIRTS, WHICH HAVE A LOT OF CONNOTATIONS FOR ME. YOU KNOW, THE OBVIOUS SID VICIOUS REFERENCE, BUT ALSO SATYAJIT RAY MOVIES, AND INDIAN BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIES MADE IN THE 1930S AND 1940S. THEY TOLD THESE DELICATELY NUANCED STORIES OF FAMILY DYNAMICS IN INDIAN VILLAGES, AND THE PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS WEARING MODEST, DRAPED MUSLIN GARMENTS WITH THESE KIND OF WIDE-NECKED, LOOSE-STRETCH, OFF-WHITE T-SHIRTS. I WAS INTRODUCED TO SATYAJIT RAY MOVIES IN THE 1980S WHEN I WENT TO A FESTIVAL. THEY WERE SO MOVING BECAUSE THE STORIES THEY TOLD WERE SET IN THESE VERY SMALL VILLAGES IN INDIA BUT WERE UNIVERSAL STORIES OF LOVING DYNAMICS; THEY WERE SO TENDER. TO THIS DAY, I STILL HAVE THOSE MOVIES ON AS BACKGROUND IMAGERY BECAUSE OF THE BLACK AND WHITE AND JUST THE BEAUTY. I LIKE THE MOOD THEY SET FOR ME. I WILL HAVE THEM ON WHILE I’M SHOWERING, WITH SOME CLASSICAL MUSIC LIKE OPERA OR SOMETHING. THOSE T-SHIRTS, THAT DINGY WHITE, THAT IS THE COLOUR I LOVE THE MOST, ALONG WITH BLACK. I ALSO LIKE IT WHEN IT’S A BIT TINGED WITH GREY AND BLUE. OVER THE YEARS WE’VE HAD A MILLION NAMES FOR IT, WE’VE CALLED IT DINGE, PEARL, BUT ONE OF THE TIPS THAT I REALLY LEARNED OVER TIME IS THAT IT SHOULD NEVER BE WHITER THAN YOUR TEETH. BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE THE T-SHIRT DIRTIER THAN YOUR TEETH, THEN YOUR TEETH LOOK WHITER. THAT IS MY LITTLE BEAUTY TIP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION, ERIC. THAT LEOPARD-PRINT CHIFFON JACKET YOU’RE WEARING IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS; THE PEARL OF THAT CHIFFON IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE ON THE BLUE-GREY SIDE. IT CAME OUT JUST RIGHT AND I’M GLAD THAT YOU HAVE IT. \n",

      " I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF RICK AND HIS WORK WHEN I WAS LIVING IN MY SMALL HOME TOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND. I WAS OBSESSED WITH QUEER CULTURE AND THE CONCEPT OF WHAT CAMP MEANT, BUT THROUGH A MORE SINISTER AND ‘DARK LENS’. MY IDOLS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PERFORMANCE ARTISTS AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS SUCH AS DAVID HOYLE, LEIGH BOWERY, AND PETE BURNS. RICK WAS THE FIRST BRAND I SAW THIS IN, AND I HAVE ALWAYS FELT ALIGNED WITH ITS WICKED SENSE OF HUMOUR, GLAMOUR, AND FIERCE EYE FOR DETAIL. THE IDEA OF HAVING A ‘DARK GLAMOUR’ APPROACH TO FASHION IS INTOXICATING TO ME. I CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF IT. RICK’S CLOTHES ARE SEXY AND COMPLICATED, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY HAVE A POINT OF VIEW. THE BRAND AND RICK HIMSELF HAVE ALLOWED ME TO FIND WHO I AM, AND THROUGH THEM I’VE FOUND A COMMUNITY THAT LOVES QUEER CULTURE AND SIMILAR ART. WE’RE INTERNATIONAL, AND THOSE OLD PUNK OR NEW ROMANTIC CLIQUES YOU SAW ON THE KINGS ROAD (À LA WESTWOOD’S WORLDS END) ARE NOW CONNECTED THROUGH THE WEB, AND WE’RE ALL OVER THE GLOBE. THAT’S WHY RICK IS SO UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT TO MY LIFE. \n",

I FELT THAT THEY WERE RIGID AND NARROW AND BIASED, AND I’M GOING TO USE THE WORD BIGOTED, AND I THOUGHT I COULD PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT. I DON’T MEAN TO BE STRIDENTLY DIFFERENT, ALTHOUGH IT CAN SEEM LIKE THAT, AND EVEN THOUGH I DON’T MEAN TO, I PROBABLY AM TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE IT TAKES ENERGY TO PROMOTE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT STANDARD. THE IDEA WAS TO BE INCLUSIVE AND TO BLUR THE BOUNDARIES OF RIGID AESTHETICS AND ALLOW MORE THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED BEAUTIFUL. IRONICALLY, I SOMETIMES I THINK I HAVE CREATED THIS WORLD THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON’T FEEL WELCOME IN. I DO REGRET THAT A LITTLE BIT, BUT I DO WHAT I CAN TO TRY AND KEEP IT AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS WHY I AM DOING COLLABORATIONS AND STUFF BECAUSE WE ARE SHOWING A DIFFERENT PART OF OUR WORLD – WE ARE OPEN. WE HAVE NO BARRIERS; WE ARE FRIENDLY. \n",
